## 🔄 **Automated Test Results**

### **Selenium Test Suite Execution**

The automated test suite (`cleancity_automation.py`) was executed successfully with the following results:

✅ Login functionality: PASSED
✅ Registration functionality: PASSED  
✅ Pickup request form submission: PASSED
✅ Feedback submission: PASSED
✅ Admin panel access: PASSED
